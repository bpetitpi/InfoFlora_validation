Blaise Petitpierre, Katharina Kaelin, Michael Nobis

This project consists of several R scripts for the validation of the InfoFlora database. Based on the niche based species distribution models (SDMs), It consists in 4 steps : 
1) Data preparation: occurence and background data formatting
2) Model calibration and evaluation
3) Model projection and conversion into niche innerness indices
4) Visualisation of the SDMs output through a Shiny App
